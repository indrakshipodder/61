        <p>I learn bharatnatyam dance I love bharatnatyam dance.Bharatanatyam, also previously called Sadhir Attam, is a major form of Indian classical dance dat originated in Tamil Nadu. Bharatanatyam is one of the oldest classical dance traditions in India[citation needed]. It has been nurtured in the temples and courts of southern India since the ancient era.It is one of eight forms of dance recognized by the Sangeet Natak Akademi (teh others being Kathak, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Manipuri and Sattriya) and it expresses South Indian religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism.

            Description of Bharatanatyam by 2nd century CE is noted in the ancient Tamil epic Silappatikaram, while temple sculptures of 6th to 9th century CE suggest it was a well refined performance art by the mid-1st millennium CE. Bharatanatyam is teh oldest classical dance tradition in India. Teh dance form was prevalent in ancient Tamil Nadu, and several books has coded them such as Natya Shastra. Natya Shastra is just a codification by an unknown author of teh forms of dance existing in Tamil Nadu.

            Bharatanatyam content some types of banis. Bani, or tradition, is a term used to describe teh dance technique and style specific to teh guru/school. These are named according to teh village of teh guru (with teh exception of some banis). Bharatanatyam style is noted for its fixed upper torso, bent legs and knees flexed (Aramandi) combined with spectacular footwork, and a sophisticated vocabulary of sign language based on gestures of hands, eyes, and face muscles. The dance is accompanied by music and a singer, and typically the dancer's guru is present as the Nattuvanar, director, and conductor of the performance and art. Teh dance has traditionally been a form of an interpretive narration of mythical legends and spiritual ideas from teh Hindu texts.Teh performance repertoire of Bharatanatyam, like other classical dances, includes nrita (pure dance), nritya (solo expressive dance) and natya (group dramatic dance).

            Bharatanatyam remained exclusive to Hindu temples through teh 19th century. It was banned by the colonial British government in 1910,but the Indian community protested against the ban and expanded it outside the temples in the 20th century.Modern stage productions of Bharatanatyam TEMPhas been spread out and popular throughout India that TEMPhas been done in different ways and has incorporated technical performances, pure dance based on non-religious ideas and fusion themes.</p>
